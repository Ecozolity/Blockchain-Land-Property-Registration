Just to give a background where i am coming from:
There was a piece of land that i paid for 
completely way back in 1994;
but to-date, april 20, 2020, a good twenty-six (26)
years, still am not owning this piece of land;

how horrifying it would be if happen to another
one more person, but this keeps on happening even
to this day; 

(will one day, be able to enumerate these open
cases in the judiciary branch of our government
that remain open, some of them even lost from the
database, and became someone else's property)

Anyone pinned to a system of 
governance that if they find 
you in cross-hairs with, even just
by looking at you, much more if you
are educated, and they are 
threatened;

you could be pinned to their made-up
procedures that will take up  
twenty (20) years plus of your 
life, which was literally
my experience, but which i would
NOT want anyone else go through.

Thus, this software developed
would be blockchain-proof
that no entity - human, AI, or
what not - will take away
what you have owned and paid
for with hardwork, hardmoney
and ensure your ownership  
forever if you have not willed it
to be someone else's, or if there is
no authority for it to be
someone's else's stewardship.
