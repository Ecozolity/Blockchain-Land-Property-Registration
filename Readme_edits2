What this author wants developed
is a software;
that will be 
blockchain-proof
from Day 1 
it is rolled out,
to be fair and tamper-proof.

That the quality controls
be done for any case
that is fed through it.

There would be no 
subjectivities,
or variabilities
or special favor.

Thus, ALL Sorts
of tests will be
done, to be
shock-proof.

Better done while
still under
development mode.
